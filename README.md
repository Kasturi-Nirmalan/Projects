# ROOT Projects

Welcome to the branch! This is where I showcase some of the projects I have done on CERN's ROOT database.



Below are the links to the projects I have done:

- **[Rutherford Scattering Simulation](https://github.com/Kasturi-Nirmalan/Projects/tree/Rutherford-Scattering-Simulation)**: A branch for the python simulation of Rutherford Scattering Project.
- **[Ionising-Radiation-Simulation](https://github.com/Kasturi-Nirmalan/Projects/tree/Ionising-Radiation-Simulation)**: A branch for the Arduino simulation of ionising radiation detector using phototransistor
