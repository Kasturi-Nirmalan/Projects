    "## Rutherford Scattering: Phenomenon and Experimental Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Rutherford Scattering is a phenomenon observed when alpha particles (helium nuclei) are deflected by the nuclei of atoms in a thin foil. This experiment, conducted by Ernest Rutherford in 1909, provided essential evidence that led to the development of the nuclear model of the atom. Before Rutherford’s discovery, the prevailing atomic model was J.J. Thomson's \"plum pudding\" model, which suggested that atoms were composed of a diffuse positive charge with electrons embedded within. Rutherford's work revealed a radically different structure: a dense, positively charged nucleus at the center of the atom, surrounded by mostly empty space. This concept laid the foundation for modern atomic theory. In this report, we will explain the basic principles of Rutherford Scattering, describe the experimental techniques used, and discuss the functionality of a provided GUI for simulating and analyzing the scattering phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Rutherford Scattering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rutherford's gold foil experiment aimed to probe the internal structure of the atom by directing alpha particles at a very thin sheet of gold. The surprising outcomes of this experiment reshaped scientific understanding of atomic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Most alpha particles passed through the foil without deflection**:  \n",
    "  This indicated that atoms consist mostly of empty space, as there was little to deflect the majority of alpha particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Some alpha particles were deflected at small angles**:  \n",
    "  This suggested the presence of a weak, repulsive force within the atom, hinting at a positively charged nucleus at the center of the atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A small fraction of alpha particles were deflected at large angles (greater than 90 degrees)**:  \n",
    "  This rare but dramatic deflection strongly indicated the presence of a tiny, dense nucleus at the atom's center. This nucleus contained most of the atom's mass and positive charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings led to the abandonment of the \"plum pudding\" model and the proposal of a new atomic model, in which electrons orbit a small, dense nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Representation of Rutherford Scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an illustration depicting Rutherford's experiment, where alpha particles are scattered by gold atoms. The image demonstrates how some particles pass through the foil unimpeded, while others are deflected due to collisions with the atomic nuclei.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rutherford's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of alpha particles \\(N(\\theta)\\) scattered at an angle \\(\\theta\\) is given by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N(\\theta) = \\frac{N_i a t}{16 r^2} \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 E_K} \\right)^2 \\csc^4 \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $N_i$ = Number of alpha particles\n",
    "- t = Thickness of foil\n",
    "- a = Number of atoms per unit volume\n",
    "- r = Distance from detector to sheet\n",
    "- $\\theta$ = Angle\n",
    "- $Z_1$ = 2\n",
    "- $Z_2$ = Atomic number of scattering foil\n",
    "- $e$ = Elementary Charge\n",
    "- $\\epsilon_0$ = Vacuum permittivity\n",
    "- $E_K$ = 1/2 $Mv^2$\n",
    "- $M$ = Mass of alpha particle\n",
    "- $v$ = Speed of alpha particle\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation describes how the number of particles scattered at a given angle depends on various factors such as the atomic number of the target material, the energy of the alpha particles, and the distance between the foil and the detector. The relationship between the scattering angle and the number of particles is governed by a $\\csc^4 \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right)$ dependence, indicating that large deflections are much less common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental setup for Rutherford Scattering typically involves three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Radioactive Source**: A substance, such as radium or polonium, that emits alpha particles. The source is usually placed in a lead container to prevent alpha particles from escaping in unwanted directions.\n",
    "- **Thin Foil**: A foil made of gold (or another metal), typically only a few atoms thick, through which the alpha particles pass.\n",
    "- **Detector**: A scintillation counter or photographic plate that measures the angles of scattered alpha particles. The detector counts the number of particles deflected at various angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment requires precise control and measurement to detect the small number of particles that are deflected at large angles. The setup allows for comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental results, validating Rutherford’s law.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GUI Functionality and User Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided GUI simulates the Rutherford Scattering experiment, offering users an interactive platform to visualize the scattering data and fit the results to Rutherford's theoretical predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User Interface Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sliders and Inputs**:\n",
    "  - $N_i$ Slider: Controls the number of incident alpha particles. This slider allows the user to increase or decrease the number of particles entering the foil.\n",
    "  - t Input: Allows the user to adjust the thickness of the foil. This value is critical because a thicker foil may cause more scattering events.\n",
    "  - $E_K$ Slider: Allows user to adjust kinetic energy of the alpha particles.\n",
    "  - $Z_2$ Dropdown: This dropdown allows users to select the atomic number of the scattering foil (e.g., selecting 79 for gold).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Buttons**:\n",
    "  - Run Simulation: This button generates a Monte Carlo simulation that calculates and displays the scattering data.\n",
    "  - Fit Curve: This button fits the simulated data to Rutherford’s analytical curve, using nonlinear least squares fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outputs**:\n",
    "  - Plot Area: Displays the scattering plot showing both the simulated data and the fitted analytical curve.\n",
    "  - Error Messages: Provides feedback and validation for input parameters, ensuring proper configuration for the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interaction Instructions:\n",
    "1. **Set Parameters**: Use the sliders and inputs to define the parameters for the simulation.\n",
    "2. **Run Simulation**: Click \"Run Simulation\" to generate the scattering data based on the chosen parameters using Monte Carlo simulation.\n",
    "3. **Theoretical Curve**: After running the simulation, click \"Theoretical Curve\" to overlay the theoretical Rutherford curve and compare it to the simulated data.\n",
    "4. **Fit Curve**: After running the simulation, click \"Fit Curve\" to overlay the curve fit and compare it to the simulated data.\n",
    "5. **Analyze Results**: Study the plot to understand how the data compares to theoretical predictions. The error messages will help resolve any issues with the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphs and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore the expected behavior of the Rutherford Scattering simulation under different conditions. By adjusting parameters like the number of incident particles $N_i$, kinetic energy $E_K$ of the alpha particles, foil thickness, and the atomic number of the scattering foil (i.e., the element of the foil), we can observe how the experimental data compares to theoretical predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Effect of Varying $N_i$ (Number of Incident Particles)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Large $N_i$**:  \n",
    "  Increasing $N_i$, the number of incident alpha particles, leads to a higher total count of scattered particles. The plot will show a more detailed distribution of scattering angles, with a smoother curve and clearer peak at smaller angles. The larger the $N_i$, the better the statistical representation of the scattering process, with fewer random fluctuations in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small $N_i$**:  \n",
    "  With a small number of incident particles, the graph will show more statistical noise, and the scattering curve will appear more erratic. Small $N_i$ values may not provide a sufficient sample to accurately capture the full distribution of scattering angles, especially the rare, large-angle deflections.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Effect of Varying Kinetic Energy (KE) of Alpha Particles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Large KE**:  \n",
    "  When the kinetic energy of the alpha particles is increased, the particles move faster. Since the scattering angle $\\theta$ depends on the repulsive force between the alpha particle and the nucleus (which is stronger when the particles are closer to the nucleus), a higher kinetic energy means the alpha particles will more likely scatter at smaller angles. This is because the increased velocity causes the alpha particles to pass by the nucleus more closely, experiencing a larger repulsion force. As a result, the number of large-angle deflections decreases, and the majority of particles are scattered at smaller angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small KE**:  \n",
    "  With lower kinetic energy, the particles move slower and are more susceptible to large-angle deflections. The particles may get closer to the nucleus, leading to stronger repulsive interactions. As a result, there will be a higher frequency of large-angle deflections compared to high-velocity particles. The curve will show a more gradual decline in the number of particles as the angle increases, with more scattered particles at larger angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Effect of Varying Foil Thickness\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Large Thickness**:  \n",
    "  Increasing the thickness of the foil increases the number of atoms the alpha particles encounter, leading to a higher probability of scattering events. However, the thicker the foil, the more interactions the alpha particles undergo, and this could lead to more scattering events at various angles. In the graph, a thicker foil may result in a broader distribution of scattering angles and an overall increase in the total number of scattered particles, particularly for small-angle deflections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small Thickness**:  \n",
    "  A thin foil results in fewer interactions because fewer alpha particles pass through the foil, reducing the total number of scattered particles. The distribution may appear narrower, with a sharper peak at smaller angles. Fewer particles will be detected, and large-angle deflections become rarer due to fewer interactions with the atoms in the foil.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Effect of Varying Atomic Number of the Scattering Foil (\\(Z_2\\))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Large $Z_2$ (Heavier Elements like Gold)**:  \n",
    "  Increasing the atomic number $Z_2$ of the scattering material enhances the repulsive electrostatic force between the positively charged alpha particles and the nucleus of the atoms in the foil. This results in a higher probability of large-angle deflections, as the stronger electric field from a heavier nucleus causes the alpha particles to experience greater deflection. The graph will show more particles being deflected at higher angles, especially with materials like gold $Z = 79$ compared to lighter elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small $Z_2$ (Lighter Elements like Carbon or Aluminum)**:  \n",
    "  For lighter elements, such as carbon $Z = 6$ or aluminum $Z = 13$, the repulsive force between the alpha particles and the nuclei is weaker. As a result, there will be fewer large-angle deflections, and the graph will show a greater number of particles scattered at smaller angles. The distribution will have a sharper peak at lower scattering angles compared to heavier elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rutherford Scattering experiment remains a cornerstone in the field of atomic physics, providing definitive evidence for the existence of a dense, positively charged nucleus within atoms. By using the provided GUI, users can interactively simulate various scattering scenarios and observe how factors like kinetic energy, foil thickness, and atomic number influence the scattering distribution.\n",
